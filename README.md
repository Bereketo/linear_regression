# House Price Prediction

This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict house prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `predict-price.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook.

## Project Structure

- `predict-price.ipynb`: This is the main file where the model is trained and predictions are made.

## Model

The model used in this project is a simple linear regression model implemented from scratch. The model is trained using gradient descent.

## Results

The model's predictions are visualized in a scatter plot, where the x-axis represents the actual house prices and the y-axis represents the predicted prices. A perfect model would have all points lie on the line y = x.

## Future Work

- Improve the model by tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of iterations.
- Try other regression models to see if they yield better results.
- Use cross-validation to get a better estimation of the models performance
